# Machine Learning

* **We have a $50 prize for anyone who builds a **_**really**_** cool ML project.** Caveat: the prize may not go to anyone. There's a reason that there's an emphasis on really. You can seek out Vihaan Sondhi, Kyle Lee, and/or Dean Chen at the event to see if your project idea might qualify or email one of them in advance at first\_name dot last\_name @teenhacksli.com.&#x20;
* [Fast.ai](https://docs.fast.ai/tutorial.html) is definitely a good choice for a library if you're just getting started with machine learning.&#x20;
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) competitions are great for finding datasets and getting ideas for things to work on.
* Image Classification
  * Fast.ai is definitely what you want to use here. Look through their tutorials to get an idea.&#x20;
* Language Modeling (aka generating text)
  * Learn using Andrej Karpathy's [great introductory course](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html). It goes from scratch to building a transformer. Extending on any of these significantly and/or implementing all of the coding exercises would be a valid project that would be both fun and an incredible learning experience.  &#x20;
* Reinforcement Learning
  * The following two resources are great for both learning and finding ideas for projects to work on.&#x20;
  * [https://arena3-chapter2-rl.streamlit.app/](https://arena3-chapter2-rl.streamlit.app/\[2.2]\_Q-Learning\_and\_DQN) -> if you're already comfortable with rl, look at the end of each section for bonus exercises if you want ideas.&#x20;
  * [https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf) -> implement algorithms from the canonical tabular RL textbook.&#x20;
* General ideas if you already have experience:
  * Get started on an autodiff library like [this](https://github.com/UlisseMini/light)
  * Implement a neural net class from scratch in Numpy. Include normalization (batch norm, layer norm), gradient clipping, lr-scheduling, dropout, several different optimizers, activation functions, and more.
* For relatively cheap GPU rental, check out [Vast.ai](https://vast.ai/) and [Lambda Labs](https://lambdalabs.com/), but Google Colab should be sufficient for most projects.
  * If you anticipate that paying for GPU rental will be a bottleneck for you, email us at finance@teenhacksli.com (cc vihaan.sondhi@teenhacksli.com) and we'll see if we can help you out.&#x20;
