# Machine Learning

If you are a beginner and want fast results and don't care too much about understanding everything, [fast.ai](https://docs.fast.ai/tutorial.html) is definitely the best library for deep learning.&#x20;

Kaggle comps are great for finding datasets and open problems to work on

### Image Classification/Computer Vision

Fast.ai is definitely what you want to use here. [https://docs.fast.ai/tutorial.vision.html](https://docs.fast.ai/tutorial.vision.html)

### Language Modeling (building a language model)

[https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) -> specifically the second to last one

### Reinforcement Learning

* [https://arena3-chapter2-rl.streamlit.app/](https://arena3-chapter2-rl.streamlit.app/\[2.2]\_Q-Learning\_and\_DQN) -> if you're already comfortable with rl, look at the end of each section for recommended exercises.
* [https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf) -> implement algorithms from the canonical tabular RL textbook.&#x20;
