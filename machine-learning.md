# Machine Learning

* [Fast.ai](https://docs.fast.ai/tutorial.html) is definitely a good choice for a library if you're just getting started with machine learning. .&#x20;
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) competitions are great for finding datasets and getting ideas for things to work on.
* Image Classification
  * Fast.ai is definitely what you want to use here. Look through their tutorials to get an idea.&#x20;
* Language Modeling&#x20;
  * Learn using Andrej Karpathy's [great introductory course](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html). It goes from scratch to building a transformer. Extending on any of these significantly and/or implementing all of the coding exercises would be a valid project that would be both fun and an incredible learning experience.  &#x20;

### Reinforcement Learning

* [https://arena3-chapter2-rl.streamlit.app/](https://arena3-chapter2-rl.streamlit.app/\[2.2]\_Q-Learning\_and\_DQN) -> if you're already comfortable with rl, look at the end of each section for recommended exercises.
* [https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf) -> implement algorithms from the canonical tabular RL textbook.&#x20;
