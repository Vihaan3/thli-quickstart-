# FAQ

**What is this?:**  This is a _free_ STEM event (a [hackathon](https://www.brightidea.com/guide/hackathon/what-is-a-hackathon/)) for high school students in Long Island (and beyond!). On January 11th at Adelphi University, \~100 teenagers will gather for 12 hours to code projects together and attend free workshops. Some of these workshops will be designed by us, and others will be designed by hand-picked mentors from nearby companies and universities. We will be carefully constructing the entire event to allow teens with any level of prior programming skill to have fun, learn something new, and build projects they never would have taken the time to build otherwise.&#x20;

**Who's eligible to sign up?**: If you're 18 or under, we would love to have you!

**What if I'm not good at coding?:** We would still love to have you! You will probably get even more out of attending as a beginner.&#x20;

**What do I get out of attending?:** Hopefully, you'll come away having learned something, programmed something you're proud of, and had tremendous amounts of fun. You could also potentially win some [prizes](basics.md#prizes)!

**What kinds of projects will I be building?:** Whatever you want, but hopefully you'll take some inspiration from [here](project-ideas.md) and build something that helps you learn and become better as a programmer.

**What if my parents have concerns?**: If it helps, we would love to get on a call with your parents or answer any questions through email. You can email us at thli@teenhacksli.com (cc laura.zhang@teenhacksli.com). &#x20;
