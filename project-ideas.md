# Project Ideas

We don't want you to make GPT wrappers (unless sufficiently unique and interesting) or janky webapps that claim to solve major issues (unless they genuinely seem to have the potential to do so).&#x20;

We want you to work on something that is at least two of the following: wacky, cool, and a good learning experience. We would recommend that instead of focusing on having an amazing idea and working on a bare-bones execution, work on something that absolutely nerd-snipes you and will genuinely help you learn more. If you happen to have a killer idea that you can't fully execute yet, go for it by all means, but know that just having a good idea will be less valued at this event than at most other hackathons you may have been to in the past. **The primary goals of this hackathon are for you to improve as a programmer and have fun doing it.**&#x20;

Hopefully, you continue working on a project you start here or that you were inspired to start working on after attending. If you do, reach out to finance@teenhacksli.com with your finished product as well as a little personal story of how it has helped you develop. If our budget allows it, we would love to buy you a gift of $25-$150.&#x20;

Ideas:

* If you're into AI, go deep and spend your time trying to implement a couple of research papers that interest you.&#x20;
  * [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10563](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10563) is a really cool one
  * backprop from scratch&#x20;
    * [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WV2oi2fh9XXyldh02wupFQX0wh5ZC-z-?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WV2oi2fh9XXyldh02wupFQX0wh5ZC-z-?usp=sharing)
  * see more ideas [here](ai.md)
* If you're into history or economics, learn about a fun new topic and then try to make an interactive Nicky Case-esque explainer (this might be [helpful](https://ncase.me/nutshell/)).
  * Some cool pieces by Nicky Cases:
    * [https://ncase.me/trust/](https://ncase.me/trust/)
    * [https://ncase.me/anxiety/](https://ncase.me/anxiety/)
    * [https://ncase.itch.io/wbwwb](https://ncase.itch.io/wbwwb)
    * [https://aisafety.dance/](https://aisafety.dance/)
* If you're into math or science, use [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/3blue1brown)'s [manim ](https://3b1b.github.io/manim/)library to make a video that explains a math/science topic. See [here](https://youtu.be/rbu7Zu5X1zI) for a video where Grant Sanderson shows how he uses manim (his version). **Note, this may be a good project to recommend to introductory programmers.**
* [Build a game for MS-DOS. ](https://retrospect.hackclub.com/dos)
* Build a game for [Sprig](https://sprig.hackclub.com/) and get a console.&#x20;
  * Introductory video [here](https://youtu.be/ZOPYB6dw4Os).
* Design something really cool for [Onboard](https://hackclub.com/onboard/).
* Design an [interactive art piece](https://blot.hackclub.com/) and got a plotter bot shipped to you.
* If you're a beginner (or even not) programmer: maybe all you do is build your first website and make it look _**awesome**_. You can also get [free boba](https://boba.hackclub.com/) for it!
* General things

  * Think of something that really annoyed you recently. Can you automate that or build something that will make it less annoying?
