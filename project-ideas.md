# Project Ideas

### Our Values

> What should your projects be? Whatever seems to you excitingly ambitious. As you grow older and your taste in projects evolves, exciting and important will converge. At 7 it may seem excitingly ambitious to build huge things out of Lego, then at 14 to teach yourself calculus, till at 21 you're starting to explore unanswered questions in physics. But always preserve excitingness.
>
> There's a kind of excited curiosity that's both the engine and the rudder of great work. It will not only drive you, but if you let it have its way, will also show you what to work on.
>
> What are you excessively curious about â€” curious to a degree that would bore most other people? That's what you're looking for.
>

**For us, the primary goals of this hackathon are to help you improve as a programmer and have fun doing it.** We want to feed your intellectual curiosity and hopefully get you started on long-term projects or goals. We want to help you focus on [sustainable learning instead of "blind creation".](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/hackathons#sustainable-learning)&#x20;

We don't want you to build janky webapps that claim to solve complex issues (unless they genuinely seem to have the potential to do so).&#x20;

You should work on something that is at least two of the following: wacky, cool, and a good learning experience. Instead of stressing over having an amazing tech-startupy idea and working on a bare-bones execution of it, work on something that absolutely [nerd-snipes](https://xkcd.com/356/) you and will genuinely help you learn more. If you happen to have a killer idea that you think has a chance of genuine impact in the future, go for it by all means, but know that _just_ having a potentially impactful idea will be less valued at this event than at most other hackathons you may have been to in the past.&#x20;

Asides:

* Your project might not even have to be programming in the traditional sense (maybe you want to work with hardware or design a robot hand). You can always email us in advance or ask during the event to see if your idea will "count" (and we will most likely say yes!).&#x20;
* If you know that you will _desperately_ need to pay for a tool, API credits, or something else, you can always reach out at finance@teenhacksli.com and we'll see what we can do.&#x20;
* Hopefully, you continue working on a project you start here or that you were inspired to start working on after attending. If you do, reach out to the finance email above with your finished project as well as a little personal story of how it has helped you develop. If our budget allows it, we would love to buy you a gift of $25-$150.&#x20;

### Ideas

The first word of any idea that seems especially beginner friendly will be marked like <mark style="color:red;">this</mark>_**.**_ Even if you think you already have a project idea, I would recommend going through these to see if they can inspire any other ideas, and to get a better understanding of the types of projects we want to encourage.&#x20;

* If have some experience with AI, go deep and spend your time trying to implement a couple of research papers that interest you.&#x20;
  * [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10563](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10563) is a really cool one
  * get started on an autodiff library like [this](https://github.com/UlisseMini/light)
  * see more ideas [here](machine-learning.md)
* <mark style="color:red;">If</mark> there's a field you find exciting (history, econ, physics, etc), learn about a fun new topic and then make an interactive Nicky Case-esque explainer.
  * Some cool pieces by Nicky Case:
    * [https://ncase.me/trust/](https://ncase.me/trust/)
    * [https://ncase.me/anxiety/](https://ncase.me/anxiety/)
    * [https://ncase.itch.io/wbwwb](https://ncase.itch.io/wbwwb)
  * For math and science particularly, use [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/3blue1brown)'s [manim](https://www.manim.community/) library to make a video that explains a math/science topic. See [here](https://youtu.be/rbu7Zu5X1zI) for a video where Grant Sanderson shows how he uses manim (his version).&#x20;
* Inspired by [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) (we aren't affiliated directly with Hack Club but highly encourage you to join) &#x20;
  * <mark style="color:red;">If</mark> you're a beginner (or even not) programmer: a worthwhile project can be to build a website and make it look _**awesome**_. You can even get [free boba](https://boba.hackclub.com/) for it from Hack Club!
  * [Build a game for MS-DOS. ](https://retrospect.hackclub.com/dos)This "you ship we ship" is sadly over, but great for inspiration.
  * <mark style="color:red;">Build</mark> a game for [Sprig](https://sprig.hackclub.com/) and get a console from Hack Club.&#x20;
    * Introductory video [here](https://youtu.be/ZOPYB6dw4Os).
  * <mark style="color:red;">Design</mark> an [interactive art piece](https://blot.hackclub.com/) and get a plotter bot shipped to you.
  * Design a [circuit board](https://hackclub.com/onboard/) and get it shipped to you (this can be a side-project you can present alongside your core project).
* Create a [personal search engine](https://github.com/thesephist/monocle).
* If you want to be the resident big idea person, check out these places (you might as well do it right):

  * [https://guzey.com/personal/what-should-you-do-with-your-life/](https://guzey.com/personal/what-should-you-do-with-your-life/)
    * especially [https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/) and [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vb8WWbsVyEJzl66\_qqtZfFr2uLL07Y7SJH5XKldjDPY/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vb8WWbsVyEJzl66\_qqtZfFr2uLL07Y7SJH5XKldjDPY/edit)
  * Think of something that has really annoyed you recently. Can you automate that or build something that will make it less annoying?
