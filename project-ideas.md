# Project Ideas

Disclaimer thingy: We don't want you to make GPT wrappers (unless sufficiently unique and interesting) or janky websites that claim to solve major issues (unless they genuinely have the potential to do so). We want you to work on something that is wacky, cool, and/or will genuinely help you learn _a ton_. This isn't the kind of event where you can just fork a winning submission that you re-use everytime.&#x20;

Ideas:

* If you're into AI, go deep and spend your time trying to implement a couple of research papers that interest you.&#x20;
  * [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10563](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10563) is a really cool one
  * do backprop from&#x20;
  * see more ideas [here](ai.md)
* If you're into history or economics, learn something and then try to make an interactive Nicky Case-esque exlainer&#x20;
  * Some cool ones&#x20;

    * [https://aisafety.dance/](https://aisafety.dance/)
  * [https://ncase.me/nutshell/](https://ncase.me/nutshell/)&#x20;
* If you're into math or science use [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/3blue1brown)'s [manim ](https://3b1b.github.io/manim/)library to make a video that explains a math/science topic.&#x20;
* Write a game for MS-DOS.&#x20;
* If you're a beginner programmer maybe all you do is build your first website and make it look really fucking (don't curse but also add a word that has the same affect) cool.&#x20;
* General things

  * Think of something that really annoyed you recently. Can you automate that or build something that will make it less annoying?
