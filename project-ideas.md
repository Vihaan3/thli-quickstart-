# Project Ideas

Disclaimer thingy to weave into this: We don't want you to make GPT wrappers (unless sufficiently unique and interesting) or janky websites that claim to solve major issues (unless they genuinely have the potential to do so). We want you to work on something that is at least two of the following: wacky, cool, or helps you learn a ton. This isn't the kind of event where you can just fork a winning submission that you re-use every time.&#x20;

Ideas:

* If you're into AI, go deep and spend your time trying to implement a couple of research papers that interest you.&#x20;
  * [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10563](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10563) is a really cool one
  * implement backprop from scratch&#x20;

  * see more ideas [here](ai.md)
* If you're into history or economics, learn about a fun new topic and then try to make an interactive Nicky Case-esque explainer&#x20;
  * Some cool ones&#x20;

  * [https://ncase.me/nutshell/](https://ncase.me/nutshell/)&#x20;
* If you're into math or science use [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/3blue1brown)'s [manim ](https://3b1b.github.io/manim/)library to make a video that explains a math/science topic.&#x20;
* Build a game for MS-DOS.&#x20;
* If you're a beginner programmer maybe all you do is build your first website and make it look really fucking (edit: don't curse but also find a word that has the same effect) cool.&#x20;
* General things

  * Think of something that really annoyed you recently. Can you automate that or build something that will make it less annoying?
