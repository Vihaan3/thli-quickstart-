# Project Ideas

> What should your projects be? Whatever seems to you excitingly ambitious. As you grow older and your taste in projects evolves, exciting and important will converge. At 7 it may seem excitingly ambitious to build huge things out of Lego, then at 14 to teach yourself calculus, till at 21 you're starting to explore unanswered questions in physics. But always preserve excitingness.
>
> There's a kind of excited curiosity that's both the engine and the rudder of great work. It will not only drive you, but if you let it have its way, will also show you what to work on.
>
> What are you excessively curious about â€” curious to a degree that would bore most other people? That's what you're looking for.

**The primary goals of this hackathon are for you to improve as a programmer and have fun doing it.** We don't want you to make GPT wrappers (unless sufficiently unique and interesting) or janky webapps that claim to solve major issues (unless they genuinely seem to have the potential to do so).&#x20;

You should work on something that is at least two of the following: wacky, cool, and a good learning experience. We would recommend that instead of stressing over having an amazing idea and working on a bare-bones execution of that idea, work on something that absolutely [nerd-snipes](https://xkcd.com/356/) you and will genuinely help you learn more. If you happen to have a killer idea that you can't fully execute yet, go for it by all means, but know that just having a good idea will be less valued at this event than at most other hackathons you may have been to in the past.&#x20;

Hopefully, you continue working on a project you start here or that you were inspired to start working on after attending. If you do, reach out to finance@teenhacksli.com (and cc vihaan.sondhi@teenhacksli.com) with your finished product as well as a little personal story of how it has helped you develop. If our budget allows it, we would love to buy you a gift of $25-$150.&#x20;

Ideas:

* If you're into AI and have some experience, go deep and spend your time trying to implement a couple of research papers that interest you.&#x20;
  * [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10563](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10563) is a really cool one
  * backprop from scratch&#x20;

  * see more ideas [here](machine-learning.md)
* If you're into something like history or economics, learn about a fun new topic and then try to make an interactive Nicky Case-esque explainer ([this](https://ncase.me/nutshell/) might be helpful).
  * Some cool pieces by Nicky Case:

* If you're into math or science, use [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/3blue1brown)'s [manim](https://www.manim.community/) library to make a video that explains a math/science topic. See [here](https://youtu.be/rbu7Zu5X1zI) for a video where Grant Sanderson shows how he uses manim (his version).&#x20;
* Inspired by [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) (we aren't affiliated directly with Hack Club but highly encourage you to join) &#x20;
  * If you're a beginner (or even not) programmer: a worthwhile project can be to build a website and make it look _**awesome**_. You can even get [free boba](https://boba.hackclub.com/) for it from Hack Club!
  * [Build a game for MS-DOS. ](https://retrospect.hackclub.com/dos)This "you ship we ship" is sadly over, but great for inspiration.
  * Build a game for [Sprig](https://sprig.hackclub.com/) and get a console from Hack Club.&#x20;
    * Introductory video [here](https://youtu.be/ZOPYB6dw4Os).
  * Design an [interactive art piece](https://blot.hackclub.com/) and get a plotter bot shipped to you.
  * Design a [circuit board](https://hackclub.com/onboard/) and get it shipped to you (this can be a side-project you can present alongside your core project).

  * Think of something that has really annoyed you recently. Can you automate that or build something that will make it less annoying?
