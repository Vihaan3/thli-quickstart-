# Basic Things

* Create an account on Github&#x20;
  * Use this to learn how to use [git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dd7KRpKeaE)
  * Install Git locally&#x20;
* Set up an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated\_development\_environment)/code editor
  * VS Code is a good starting option
* Try to get to some level of basic coding proficiency (many people assume they can quickly pick everything up at the event and are sorely disappointed)
  * With a relatively small time investment, you can get to a baseline level of coding proficiency through Kaggle's [course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-programming).&#x20;
  * (Aside) Learning in the future:
    * If you want a designed curriculum to learn quickly upfront before unleashing yourself, check out [Harvard's CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/).&#x20;
    * If you feel comfortable just learning by doing then...just do! Try to build projects and search things up when you don't get them. Adopt a mindset of ["how hard can it be"](https://jacobgw.com/blog/advice/2023/05/20/advice-about-programming.html) (the answer 80% of the time: way harder than you thought but at least you got to learn a ton).&#x20;
    * There's no clear evidence that any method is better than the other so be very in tune with yourself. If you feel like you aren't learning best in your current method, switch to something else. Don't fall prey to the [sunk cost fallacy](https://www.google.com/search?q=sunk+cost+fallacy\&oq=sunk+cost+fallacy\&sourceid=chrome\&ie=UTF-8)!
