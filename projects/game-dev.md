# Game Dev

* **$50 prize for&#x20;**_**really**_**&#x20;cool games.** It follows the same structure as our machine learning prize, so check out the top bullet point on that page for more info.&#x20;
* Look into building a game for [Sprig](https://sprig.hackclub.com/) and get a console from Hack Club.
* You can potentially get started with game development using these resources (although you would have to build off of these significantly):
  * [Jumping Over Chairs w/ Construct 3](https://blog.srnd.org/jumping-over-chairs-and-learning-to-make-a-game-with-construct-2-a796f4def9e9)
  * [Hungry Monkey w/ Pygame](https://hackclub.notion.site/counterspell-pygame)
  * [Flappy Bird w/ Unity](https://youtu.be/XtQMytORBmM)
  * [Gamemaker Tutorial](https://gamemaker.hackclub.dev/)
  * [Hack Club Workshops ](https://workshops.hackclub.com/#games)
* Don't overcomplicate it. Brainstorm a game that would be fun to play and figure out a way to create it starting with whatever programming knowledge you have. If it ends up being too simple, add interesting new quirks.
