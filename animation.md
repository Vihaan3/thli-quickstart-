# Animation

**TODO: find a friend who's good at animation and ask them for help here**

**We have a $50 prize for anyone who works on a **_**really**_** cool animated video using manim.** Caveat: the prize may not go to anyone. There's a reason that there's an emphasis on really. You can seek out Vihaan Sondhi, Kyle Lee, and/or Thomas Liu at the event to see if your project idea might qualify or email one of them in advance at first\_name dot last\_name @teenhacksli.com.&#x20;

Use [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/3blue1brown)'s [manim](https://www.manim.community/) library to make a video that explains a math/science topic. See [here](https://youtu.be/rbu7Zu5X1zI) for a video where Grant Sanderson shows how he uses manim (his version).&#x20;
