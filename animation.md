Use [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/3blue1brown)'s [manim](https://www.manim.community/) library to make a video that explains a math/science topic. See [here](https://youtu.be/rbu7Zu5X1zI) for a video where Grant Sanderson shows how he uses manim (his version).&#x20;

**We have a $50 prize for anyone who works on a&#x20;**_**really**_**&#x20;cool animated video using manim.** It follows the same structure as our machine learning prize, so check out the top bullet point on that page for more info.&#x20;
