# Animation

Use [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/3blue1brown)'s [manim](https://www.manim.community/) library to make a video that explains a math/science topic. See [here](https://youtu.be/rbu7Zu5X1zI) for a video where Grant Sanderson shows how he uses manim (his version).&#x20;

**Edit: find a friend who's good at animation and ask them for help here**
