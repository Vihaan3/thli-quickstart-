# Game Development

* If you're a beginner (or even if not)
  * Look into building a game for [Sprig](https://sprig.hackclub.com/) and get a console from Hack Club.
  * Don't overcomplicate it. Brainstorm a game that would be fun to play and figure out a way to create it starting with whatever programming knowledge you have. If it ended up being too simple, add interesting new quirks.
  * You can practice and potentially get some ideas from [here](https://workshops.hackclub.com/#games). Directly following one of these won't be enough to count as a final project unless you sufficiently build on top of it.&#x20;
