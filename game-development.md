# Game Development

* If you're a beginner (or even if not)
  * Build a game for [Sprig](https://sprig.hackclub.com/) and get a console from Hack Club.
  * Don't overcomplicate it. Brainstorm a game that would be fun to play and figure out a way to create it starting with whatever programming knowledge you have. If it ended up being too simple, add interesting new quirks.&#x20;
