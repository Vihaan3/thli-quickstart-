# Web Dev

**TODO: find a friend who's good at web dev and ask them for help here. Make this page quite extensive with resources because it is something many people will be interested in.**&#x20;

* Actual Development
  * Using HTML, CSS, and JS is the traditional default, but there are _tons_ of frameworks you can use.&#x20;
    * Tailwind, Astro, Svelte are all popular front-end wise
    * Next.js, Express.js, Flask and Django for Python devs (Flask is more lightweight) are all popular back-end wise
    * We've only listed these here to give you an idea of the extent of the space and some of the biggest names. Just start from whatever programming language(s) you know best and find a framework that has a good balance between power and a low learning curve. Don't waste too much time worrying about it for this event.&#x20;
      * How to learn:
        * Start with a relatively short general tutorial if you want to get a general idea of how things work.&#x20;
        * Just search things up! You'll learn best by just figuring out how to do things as you go instead of trying to memorize everything in advance.
* Hosting
  * Github pages (for a static website)
  * Vercel (especially if you're working with Next)
