Some explainer of why this exists and how to use it. \
**Draft 1** = In previous hackathons, we've noticed that a high percentage of our attendees are new to programming, and often have a hard time even getting started. We've been searching for ways to lower this friction as much as possible so that you can really experience what it's like to enjoy hacking on a project with friends instead of getting frustrated searching for the right tools and getting lost in the weeds.&#x20;

We've also noticed that a lot of the projects our attendees end up building converge towards something relatively similar, and we wanted to provide inspiration for project ideas and pointers to interesting topics so that we have a diverse range of final submissions and everyone comes away from the event learning new things and building something they're proud of.

This is our answer to that. (edit: this last sentence is stupid, figure out something better. Also this entire thing is worded really badly and doesn't convey the intended vibe.)&#x20;

TODO:

* [ ] Clean up all pages
* [ ] Ask friends who've been to hackathons for pages to add and other cool project ideas
* [ ] Get help from others at the things I'm not good at&#x20;
  * [ ] Web dev
  * [ ] Game Dev
  * [ ] Data Analysis
* [ ] Does animation really need to be a separate page?&#x20;
