Hey! This is the starter guide for attendees at [TeenHacks LI's](https://teenhacksli.com/) (apologies for any lag; the website is under renovation) sixth hackathon on January 11th at Adelphi University. This starter guide tries to solve a couple of major things that we've noticed after previous events.&#x20;

1. The projects our attendees build often end up quite similar to each other and many attendees don't work on projects that they have an emotional connection to. That's why this year's theme is for you to build projects centered around your hobbies, passions, and talents. We've also provided additional inspiration and some guidelines on the kinds of projects our hackathons values [here](project-ideas.md). &#x20;
2. A high percentage of our attendees are beginning programmers and often have a hard time even getting started. We've tried to add as many resources as possible to help you get started in whatever topic you're interested in as a way. Hopefully, this will make it more likely that you have a great experience hacking on a project with friends rather than spending hours trying to find the right tools and getting frustrated (although that's a key part of the programming experience as well!).&#x20;

We want you to treat this as less of a competition to win and more as a space where you can have fun, learn something new, and build projects you never would have taken the time to build otherwise. If you approach everything with **playful curiosity** and do whatever feels to you **excitingly ambitious**, you'll come out better than you came in!
